# Node + Express Service Starter

This is a simple API sample in Node.js with express.js based on [Google Cloud Run Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-nodejs-service).

## Getting Started

Server should run automatically when starting a workspace. To run manually, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```

## Chapter 2: Process Modeling API Enhancements

This chapter details the significant enhancements made to the Process Definition API to support dynamic process modeling from a frontend application, robust versioning, and a clear lifecycle for process definitions.

### 1. Unified Process Saving Endpoint

The `POST` and `PUT` endpoints for process definitions have been consolidated into a single, intelligent service. This simplifies the API and handles complex logic on the backend.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/processes/` (for creation)
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/processes/:id` (for updates)
- **Service Logic (`saveProcessDefinition`):**
    - **Smart Updates:** When updating a process in `DRAFT` state, the service performs an intelligent synchronization: it updates existing elements, creates new ones, and deletes those that were removed, without creating a new version.
    - **Automatic Versioning:** If a `PUT` request is made to a process that is `ACTIVE` or has running instances, the service automatically creates a new version. The previous version is marked as `DEPRECATED`, ensuring that ongoing instances are not affected.

### 2. Partial Metadata Updates

A new endpoint has been introduced to allow for partial updates of a process definition's metadata without triggering a new version. This is ideal for changing a process's name, description, or status.

- **Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/processes/:id`
- **Allowed Fields:** `name`, `description`, `category`, `status`.
- **Use Case:** An administrator can use this to manually change a process status from `ACTIVE` to `INACTIVE`, for example.

### 3. Decoupled API Payload

The API contract for creating and retrieving process definitions is now decoupled from the frontend's view layer.

- **`diagramJson`:** This field in the payload stores the raw JSON from the frontend modeling tool (e.g., SvelteFlow). The backend treats it as opaque data, responsible only for storing and retrieving it.
- **`elements` & `sequences`:** These arrays contain a clean, structured representation of the process's business logic (nodes and their connections). This is the data the backend's process engine uses.

### 4. Robust Process Lifecycle and Statuses

The process definition lifecycle is now managed by four distinct statuses:

- **`DRAFT`**: An in-design process that has not been activated yet. Can be freely edited.
- **`ACTIVE`**: The single, executable version of a business process. The system ensures only one version can be `ACTIVE` per `businessProcessKey`.
- **`DEPRECATED`**: An older version that was automatically replaced by a newer `ACTIVE` version.
- **`INACTIVE`**: A process that was manually archived or disabled by an administrator via the `PATCH` endpoint.

### 5. Admin-Only Endpoint for All Processes

To support the process modeler, a new administrative endpoint has been added to retrieve all process definitions, regardless of their status.

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/processes/all`
- **Security:** Requires administrator privileges.
- **Purpose:** Allows administrators to view and manage processes that are in `DRAFT`, `DEPRECATED`, or `INACTIVE` states. The standard `GET /api/processes/` endpoint still returns only `ACTIVE` processes for regular users.

### 6. Guaranteed Cascade Deletion

The `DELETE /api/processes/:id` endpoint now enforces cascade deletion at the application layer within a transaction. This ensures that when a process definition is deleted, all its associated elements and sequences are reliably removed, maintaining database integrity.

## Chapter 3: Business Logic as a Service

The backend now exposes the process engine's decision-making capabilities as a standalone, stateless service. This allows external systems to leverage the modeled business logic without needing to create a process instance, effectively turning the platform into a "Business Logic as a Service".

### 1. "Decide Next Task" Endpoint

This is the core of the service. An external application can ask the engine what the next step in a process should be, based on a given context.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/engine/decide-next-task`
- **Functionality:** The service simulates the process flow from a given starting point (`currentBpmnElementId`). It traverses the process graph, recursively solving any intermediate gateways by evaluating their conditions against the provided `contextData`, until it finds the next blocking task(s) (`USER_TASK`, `AUTO_TASK`) or the end of the process (`END_EVENT`).

#### Request Payload Example:
```json
{
  "businessProcessKey": "PURCHASE_REQUEST",
  "currentBpmnElementId": "StartEvent_Purchase",
  "contextData": {
    "task": {},
    "instance": {
      "businessData": {
        "purchaseAmount": 1501
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Response Payload Example:
```json
{
  "nextTasks": [
    {
      "bpmnElementId": "Task_HighValueApproval",
      "name": "Aprobaci√≥n de Alto Valor",
      "type": "USER_TASK",
      "assignedRoleId": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Auditing with Decision Logs

Every call to the decision service is audited to provide full traceability.

- **Persistence:** Each request and its corresponding response (or error) is stored in the `decision_logs` table. This log includes which user made the request, the full request payload, the response, and timestamps.
- **Query Endpoint:** A new administrative endpoint is available to query these logs.
    - **Endpoint:** `GET /api/engine/decision-logs`
    - **Security:** Requires administrator privileges.
